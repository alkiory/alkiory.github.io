The other day I came across a curious image: someone with **three screens**.

* On one, an anime was running.
* On another, there was an open terminal with code executing.
* And on the third, a document with tasks or notes.

My reaction was a mixture of empathy and doubt: *"Is this focus or chaos disguised as performance?"*

On the surface, this scene conveys a modern idea of productivity: "doing many things at once." But is it really?

## Multitasking Sounds Good... But It Doesn't Work So Well

Multitasking has been romanticized. The idea of being able to answer emails while coding, review a design while listening to a daily stand-up, and have a tutorial playing in the background while finishing a ticket.

The reality is different: **the brain doesn't process several complex tasks simultaneously**; instead, it rapidly switches context between them. This constant jumping consumes cognitive energy and increases errors.

> Doing many things at once doesn't make you more productive. It just makes you more tired.

### From Professional Experience

As developers, architects, or technical leads, we deal with multiple fronts: urgent bugs, meetings, code reviews, and new features. It seems inevitable to multitask. However, the moments of greatest professional impact almost always come from **deep focus**: that block of time where we truly connect with the problem we're solving.

> "Being busy" all day is not the same as making progress on what's important.

### From Daily Life

Even outside of work, we have normalized multitasking: cooking while listening to a podcast, answering messages during a conversation, or checking social media while watching a series. We do it out of habit, not necessity.

And the result is similar: less presence, more exhaustion, less enjoyment.

## So, What Do We Do?

It's not about eliminating all multitasking, but about identifying when it truly **sabotages** us. Here are some practical ideas:

* 🧠 **Focus blocks**: Reserve at least 1 hour a day without interruptions for cognitively demanding tasks.
* 🔕 **Silence notifications** during key moments.
* ✅ **Do one thing at a time**, even if it seems slower at first.
* 📵 **Screen-free breaks** between work blocks.
* 📝 **Short list of priorities**: Choose 1 or 2 key tasks for the day that will define whether it was productive.

### In Conclusion

You're not alone. We all fall into the trap of "being busy" without being effective. But every time you choose to do **less, but better**, you are training your mind for what truly matters.

Productivity isn't about how many tabs you have open, but how much attention you are capable of sustaining.
